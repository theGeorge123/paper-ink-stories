    "As the sun dipped below the horizon, a curious little dragon stretched their shimmering wings and listened to the evening hush. The last rays of light painted their scales in soft gold and rose.\n\nOn the windowsill, a tiny lantern glowed to life, as if the garden itself was calling out for adventure.",
    "Outside, moonlight pooled like silver paint across the grass. Flowers closed their petals with sleepy smiles, and fireflies stitched tiny constellations through the air.\n\nThe little dragon tiptoed along the path, careful not to wake the dew, and tucked a warm scarf around their neck like a cozy cloud.",
    "At the heart of the garden, a willow tree swayed in a gentle rhythm, its branches forming a curtain of green. The dragon brushed them aside and found a circle of moss, as soft as a lullaby.\n\nA wise owl blinked down from above. \"This is a place for brave hearts,\" the owl whispered. \"And yours is the brightest.\"",
    "The little dragon curled up in the moss, feeling the earth breathe beneath them. They counted the stars — one for courage, two for kindness, three for curiosity.\n\nThe night wrapped around them like a blanket, and the garden hummed a quiet song just for them.",
    "\"Goodnight, little one,\" sighed the willow, its leaves brushing their shoulders. The dragon smiled, knowing they were safe and loved.\n\nWith the moon shining softly above, the little dragon drifted into dreams filled with gentle adventures and glowing skies.",
