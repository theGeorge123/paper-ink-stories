  pages: [
    "Luna the brave dragon stretched her shimmering wings and listened to the evening hush. The last rays of sun slipped behind the hills, painting her scales in soft gold and rose.\n\nOn the windowsill, a tiny lantern glowed to life, as if the garden itself was calling her name.",
    "Outside, moonlight pooled like silver paint across the grass. Flowers closed their petals with sleepy smiles, and fireflies stitched tiny constellations through the air.\n\nLuna tiptoed along the path, careful not to wake the dew, and tucked a warm scarf around her neck like a cozy cloud.",
    "At the heart of the garden, a willow tree swayed in a gentle rhythm, its branches forming a curtain of green. Luna brushed them aside and found a circle of moss, as soft as a lullaby.\n\nA wise owl blinked down at her. \"This is a place for brave hearts,\" the owl whispered. \"And yours is the brightest.\"",
    "Luna curled up in the moss, feeling the earth breathe beneath her. She counted the stars — one for her courage, two for her kindness, three for her curiosity.\n\nThe night wrapped around her like a blanket, and the garden hummed a quiet song just for her.",
    "\"Goodnight, Luna,\" sighed the willow, its leaves brushing her shoulders. Luna smiled, knowing she was safe and loved.\n\nWith the moon shining softly above, the dragon drifted into dreams filled with gentle adventures and glowing skies.",
